The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the GiLi ERP application from an MVP into a robust retail solution, focusing on comprehensive module development and critical bug fixes. Key achievements include the full implementation of Master Data (Items, Customers, Suppliers) with configurable fields, Credit Note and Debit Note modules with CRUD and Send functionalities, and a complete Financial Management system encompassing models, routers, and frontend components for accounting, payments, and reporting, with multi-currency, GST, and Indian accounting standards support.

Significant bugs addressed include incorrect amount calculations in financial documents, a persistent sent 5h ago timestamp issue, UI stretching in transaction lists, global search enhancements, and a critical login issue caused by an incorrect frontend API URL. The engineer also transitioned from mocked to real SMS/email integrations (Twilio, SendGrid) and introduced dynamic autocomplete search for master data selection. A major architectural improvement was the introduction of a centralized  service to ensure uniformity in send status tracking across all relevant modules. The final interaction concludes with the user inquiring about further financial features, indicating the Financial Management system is now a core part of the application.

The GiLi project is an ERPNext MVP clone for retail, built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, including an offline Electron PoS. Initial features included CRUD APIs, authentication, global search, and advanced reporting. The application evolved to include full CRUD, view, and Send capabilities for Sales Invoices, Sales Orders, Quotations, Purchase Orders, and Purchase Invoices, with advanced list features. Recent requirements expanded to a collapsible sidebar, robust Create and Global Search, a complete Stock module, and full CRUD for Items, Customers, and Suppliers with configurable fields managed via General Settings. Credit Note and Debit Note modules were added, and real SMS/Email functionality (Twilio, SendGrid) with PDF attachments, dynamic item/customer population using autocomplete search, and uniform send status tracking were implemented. Most recently, a comprehensive Financial Management system was built, incorporating models, services, and frontend components for accounting, payments, bank reconciliation, and financial reports, designed to handle multi-currency, GST/Tax compliance, and Indian accounting standards, integrating with existing Sales and Purchase modules.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented a comprehensive Financial Management system within the GiLi ERP application. This involved:

1.  **Backend Implementation**:
    *   Creating new Pydantic models in  for various financial entities like , , , , , , and .
    *   Adding corresponding MongoDB collections in .
    *   Developing a new FastAPI router () to handle CRUD operations and logic for these financial modules.
    *   Registering the new router in .
    *   Expanding the  () to include financial configurations like multi-currency, GST/Tax compliance, and accounting standards (defaulting to Indian).

2.  **Frontend Implementation**:
    *   Creating several new React components in :
        *   
        *   
        *   
        *   
        *   
    *   Integrating these new components into the main application routing in .
    *   Updating the sidebar ( and ) to include the Financial module for easy navigation.
    *   Adding new API endpoints for financial operations to the centralized API client ().

This phase completed the core Financial Management system, building upon the existing Sales and Purchase modules as requested by the user, and was verified with backend and frontend tests. The user then asked what else left in financial and inquired about switching LLM models.

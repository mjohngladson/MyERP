The trajectory details a comprehensive development effort, beginning with critical environment setup and feature enhancements, and then pivoting to significant financial module additions and debugging. The initial phase focused on resolving a frontend URL mismatch in the supervisor configuration and automating document workflows (Quotations, Sales, Purchase, Invoices) to trigger accounting entries and subsequent document creation upon direct submission. The environment was then explicitly switched between Railway production and Preview for development.

A major part of the trajectory involved implementing Payment-Invoice Allocation and Bank Reconciliation features. This included creating new backend routers, frontend components, and integrating them into the existing application structure. Extensive debugging was necessary to address issues like  errors, 307 redirects during invoice loading, corrupted invoice IDs (MongoDB ObjectId vs. UUID), and incorrect database collection lookups in the payment allocation logic. The AI engineer also corrected a critical workflow bug where Sales/Purchase Invoices were incorrectly auto-creating Payment Entries instead of just Journal Entries.

The most recent work initiated is the enhancement of Credit Notes and Debit Notes, making invoice selection optional, auto-fetching customer/supplier information, and creating enhanced accounting helpers. This demonstrates an iterative process of feature addition, rigorous debugging, and continuous refinement based on user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The GiLi project is an ERPNext MVP clone for retail, built using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, complemented by an offline Electron PoS. It provides core CRUD, view, and Send functionalities for Sales Invoices, Sales Orders, Quotations, Purchase Orders, and Purchase Invoices, alongside advanced list features, a collapsible sidebar, and a robust Global Search. The system integrates a comprehensive Stock module, full CRUD for Items, Customers, and Suppliers, and advanced Credit Note/Debit Note modules with real SMS/Email integration (Twilio, SendGrid), dynamic autocompletes, and uniform send status tracking. A comprehensive Financial Management system has been implemented for accounting, payments, bank reconciliation, and financial reports, designed for multi-currency and Indian tax compliance. Recent work addressed financial module issues, automated document workflows (triggering journal entries/follow-up documents upon submission), refined transaction forms, improved validation, and added mandatory field indicators. The application requires accurate routing, secure HTTPS communication, and flexible deployment between preview and production environments. The user specifically requested implementing Payment-Invoice Allocation and Bank Reconciliation features, and later, an enhancement to review CN and DN - Make invoice selection optional. Automatically fetch Customer/Supplier when invoice is selected. Adjust invoice balance and AR/AP if linked. Handle fully paid invoices via credit or refund workflow. Maintain audit trail of CN/DN with reference to invoice if linked.

**Key File Changes Summary:**
-  (NEW): Implements API endpoints for allocating payments to invoices, handling different party types (customer/supplier), and updating invoice statuses.
-  (NEW): Provides API endpoints for uploading bank statements, matching transactions, and generating reconciliation reports.
-  (NEW): Frontend component for displaying available invoices and submitting payment allocations. Modified to handle correct invoice fetching based on payment type and improved error handling.
-  (NEW): Frontend dashboard for uploading statements, initiating matching, and viewing reports. Includes UI for displaying matched/unmatched transactions. Modified to include X icon import and better error handling.
- : Modified to register the newly created  and  routers.
- : Updated to include imports for  and , and configure their routes within the application's financial management section.
-  & : Updated to add Bank Reconciliation to the financial submenu for navigation.
- : Modified to integrate  as a modal, add an Allocate button, and manage its visibility and data flow. Fixes include passing necessary state setters (, ) to the .
-  & : Critical changes to remove automatic  creation upon invoice submission, ensuring only  are created. Also, fixed the logic for assigning the uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) field from MongoDB  to ensure proper UUIDs are used, preventing invoice lookup errors.
- : Modified to reflect the changes in invoice workflow, removing payment entry creation.
-  (NEW): A script created to identify and fix corrupted uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) fields in MongoDB (where uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) was a string representation of  instead of a UUID) for both sales and purchase invoices.
-  (NEW): Centralizes enhanced accounting logic for Credit Notes and Debit Notes, adjusting invoice balances and handling linked transactions.
-  & : Modified to integrate the new , make invoice selection optional, auto-populate customer/supplier, and include items validation and audit information in the return messages.
- : Modified multiple times to switch the  environment variable for the  program between Railway production and Preview environments for testing.
- : Continuously updated with backend and frontend test tasks, agent communications, and metadata.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement and verify the Credit Note and Debit Note enhancements:
    - Handle fully paid invoices via credit or refund workflow.
    - Maintain audit trail of CN/DN with reference to invoice if linked (beyond basic helper integration).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the Credit Notes (CN) and Debit Notes (DN) functionality based on explicit user requirements. The work involved:
1.  **Creating a new helper module**:  was created to centralize enhanced accounting logic for CN/DN, specifically to adjust invoice balances and manage linked transactions.
2.  **Updating Credit Notes router ()**: The  endpoint was modified to use the new enhanced helpers. Invoice selection was made optional, with customer name validation adjusted to auto-fill if an invoice is selected. Items validation was added. The return message structure was updated to include audit information.
3.  **Updating Debit Notes router ()**: Similar to credit notes, the  endpoint was updated to use the enhanced helpers. Supplier auto-population was implemented when an invoice is selected, and items validation was added.
4.  **Backend restart**: The backend was restarted (, ) to apply these changes.
5.  **Documentation**: A new documentation file, , was created to summarize these implementation steps.

The current state is that the backend logic for making invoice selection optional and auto-populating customer/supplier in CN/DN, along with basic accounting adjustments, has been implemented and the backend restarted. The next logical step is to verify this functionality.

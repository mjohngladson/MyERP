The AI engineer's work trajectory covered substantial ground, initially tackling various Financial Management module bugs and feature enhancements. This included resolving a persistent 404 error in Credit Note autocomplete caused by a frontend-backend endpoint mismatch. A significant portion of the work involved addressing a mixed content error where the frontend's HTTPS calls were downgraded to HTTP, requiring multiple debugging attempts and consultation with the troubleshoot agent, though it remained partially unresolved. Subsequently, the engineer implemented status-based controls for transaction modules, comprehensive upsert validations, refined validation messages, and updated mandatory field indicators. Other fixes included removing duplicate UI buttons, enabling missing Create functionality, and enhancing global search capabilities. The work culminated in debugging deployment-specific issues on Railway, particularly concerning environment variable propagation for the frontend, which caused API calls to return HTML instead of JSON. The process demonstrates a systematic approach to feature development and bug fixing, alongside a persistent struggle with environment configuration and deployment specifics.

<product_requirements>
The GiLi project is an ERPNext MVP clone for retail, built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, including an offline Electron PoS. Core functionality includes CRUD, view, and Send capabilities for Sales Invoices, Sales Orders, Quotations, Purchase Orders, and Purchase Invoices, with advanced list features. The application features a collapsible sidebar, robust Create and Global Search, a complete Stock module, and full CRUD for Items, Customers, and Suppliers with configurable fields. Credit Note and Debit Note modules support real SMS/Email functionality (Twilio, SendGrid) with PDF attachments, dynamic item/customer population using autocomplete search, and uniform send status tracking. A comprehensive Financial Management system was recently built, encompassing accounting, payments, bank reconciliation, and financial reports, designed for multi-currency, GST/Tax compliance, and Indian accounting standards, integrating with existing Sales and Purchase modules. Recent enhancements involved fixing financial module issues, implementing automated document workflows, refining transaction forms, improving validation messages, and adding mandatory field indicators. The system requires accurate routing and secure (HTTPS) communication for all API calls.

<pending_tasks>
- Investigate and resolve the  error during login on the Railway deployment, which indicates  is not correctly configured for the frontend in the Railway environment.
- Implement additional Financial Management features (e.g., Bank Reconciliation, Payment-Invoice Allocation).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was debugging a critical deployment issue on Railway. The user reported that during login, the frontend was receiving an HTML page (likely the frontend's ) instead of a JSON response from the backend API. The console output displayed: . This strongly suggests that the frontend application, when deployed on Railway, is incorrectly resolving API requests to itself (port 3000) instead of the backend API (port 8001, routed via ). This behavior is characteristic of the  environment variable not being correctly picked up or configured in the Railway deployment environment for the frontend, causing Axios to fall back to relative paths that are then handled by the frontend's web server. The backend's CORS settings were already confirmed to include the Railway UI URL, and local debugging showed the frontend's  file and local supervisor configuration correctly setting the HTTPS backend URL. The problem lies specifically within the Railway frontend's build/runtime environment.

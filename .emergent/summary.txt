The AI engineer successfully progressed the GiLi ERP application from an MVP to a feature-rich retail solution. Key accomplishments include implementing comprehensive Master Data (Items, Customers, Suppliers) with configurable fields driven by a consolidated General Settings system. The project also saw the addition of full Credit Note and Debit Note modules, complete with CRUD, view pages, collapsible/filter-aware statistics, and a Send functionality. Throughout this, the engineer addressed several critical bugs, such as incorrect dropdown data population, UI stretching in lists, a runtime error in reports caused by missing backend endpoints, and issues with the send modal. The work demonstrates an iterative approach, fixing bugs while expanding core ERP functionality. The current focus is on integrating real-time SMS/email services and enhancing user experience by replacing static dropdowns with dynamic autocomplete search for master data selection.

The GiLi project aims to be a comprehensive React/FastAPI/MongoDB ERPNext MVP clone, including an offline Electron PoS, designed for retail. Initial requirements covered CRUD APIs, authentication, global search, and advanced reporting. The application expanded to include a complete Sales Invoice System, which evolved to full CRUD, view, and Send capabilities for Sales Invoices, Sales Orders, and Quotations, alongside advanced list features (sorting, filtering, debounced search) and manual status changes. Subsequently, Purchase Order and Purchase Invoice modules were implemented. Recent user requirements have driven the development of a collapsible/persistent sidebar, robust Create and Global Search features, a complete Stock module (Items, Warehouses, Stock Entries, Ledger, Reports), and full CRUD for Items, Customers, and Suppliers with rich, configurable fields based on ERP for retail standards, all managed via a consolidated General Settings system. Most recently, Credit Note and Debit Note modules were added, and the current focus is on implementing real SMS/Email functionality and dynamic item/customer population.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was systematically addressing a list of critical bugs and functionality enhancements for the recently implemented Credit Note and Debit Note modules, as well as general UI/UX issues. These included:
1.  **Bug Fixes**:
    *   **Send Modal Contact Field**: Corrected an issue in  and  where email addresses were incorrectly populating the phone field when switching send methods.
    *   **Amount Calculation**: Verified that the amount calculation in  was already correct.
    *   **Dynamic Item/Customer/Supplier Population**: Enhanced  and  to load items, customers, and suppliers dynamically from master data, initially using dropdowns, to ensure data consistency.
    *   **PDF Attachment for Email**: Added support for attaching PDFs to emails in the backend () and integrated this functionality into the frontend Send modals.
    *   **Feedback Messages**: Improved frontend feedback messages for user actions.
2.  **Preparations for Advanced UX/Integrations**: Following user feedback, the engineer has started the process to transition from mocked SMS/email to real integrations and replace static dropdowns with autocomplete search inputs. The integration playbooks for  and  (for SMS) have been successfully retrieved.

The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the GiLi ERP application, focusing on critical financial module enhancements and extensive debugging. Initial tasks included fixing a frontend URL mismatch in supervisor config, automating document workflows, and implementing Payment-Invoice Allocation and Bank Reconciliation. A significant portion involved refining Credit Note and Debit Note functionality, addressing over-credit scenarios, cumulative tracking, and payment allocation reversals. Challenges included persistent UI caching issues, multiple MongoDB instances, corrupted account IDs, and incorrect accounting entries for Purchase Invoices, Trial Balance, and Profit & Loss statements. The AI engineer systematically debugged and corrected these, including a critical fix for duplicate Journal Entries in CN/DN workflows and ensuring tax accounts are correctly excluded from P&L. The process involved rigorous testing, database cleaning, and environment configuration adjustments.

<product_requirements>
The GiLi project aims to be an ERPNext MVP clone for retail, featuring React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, with an Electron PoS. Core functionalities include CRUD, view, and Send for Sales/Purchase documents (Invoices, Orders, Quotations), Stock management, Items, Customers, Suppliers, and advanced Credit/Debit Note modules with SMS/Email integration, dynamic autocompletes, and send status tracking. A comprehensive Financial Management system covers accounting, payments, bank reconciliation, and financial reports, supporting multi-currency and Indian tax compliance. Recent work focused on financial module issues, automated document workflows to trigger journal entries, refining transaction forms, improving validation, and mandatory field indicators. Specific user requests included:
1.  **Payment-Invoice Allocation:** Implementing features for allocating payments to invoices.
2.  **Bank Reconciliation:** Developing functionalities for bank statement reconciliation.
3.  **Credit Note (CN) & Debit Note (DN) Enhancements:**
    *   Make invoice selection optional.
    *   Automatically fetch Customer/Supplier when an invoice is selected.
    *   Adjust invoice balance and AR/AP if linked.
    *   Handle fully paid invoices via credit or refund workflow.
    *   Maintain an audit trail of CN/DN with reference to the invoice.
    *   Implement logic to reject over-credit scenarios.
    *   Track cumulative CN/DN amounts to prevent exceeding original invoice.
    *   Ensure proper payment allocation reversal upon CN/DN creation.
4.  **Financial Reporting Accuracy:** Correct Journal Entry logic for Purchase Invoices, ensure accurate Trial Balance, and refine Profit & Loss statement to show Net Purchases (Purchases - Purchase Returns) and exclude tax accounts.

**Key File Changes Summary:**
*    (NEW & MODIFIED): Centralized logic for CN/DN. Handles over-credit validation, tracks cumulative amounts, manages payment allocation reversals, and critically, removed redundant adjustment JEs for partially paid invoices.
*    &  (MODIFIED): Integrated , made invoice selection optional, auto-populated customer/supplier, added items validation, and ensured default dates for new entries.
*    (MODIFIED): Fixed Trial Balance logic by updating account  mappings. Rewrote Profit & Loss logic to calculate Net Purchases (Purchases - Purchase Returns) and correctly exclude tax accounts, addressing sign bugs for Sales Returns.
*    (MODIFIED): Updated Journal Entry creation for Purchase Invoices and Sales Invoices to use specific Input Tax Credit and Output Tax Payable accounts respectively.
*    (MODIFIED): Added new tax accounts (Input Tax Credit, Output Tax Payable) and corrected  for existing accounts, notably Purchase Returns changed to .
*    (MODIFIED): The  for the frontend program was repeatedly modified and finally fixed to ensure the frontend connects to the correct backend instance, resolving CORS and login issues.
*    (MODIFIED): Added  to ensure it's recognized. Also, database name was clarified for cleanup scripts.

    - Leave Linking of all journal entries for later (as per user instruction).
    - Concurrency safety (deferred).
- Verify the corrected Profit & Loss statement with comprehensive data and edge cases.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on ensuring the accuracy of the **Profit & Loss (P&L) statement**. This involved addressing several critical accounting logic issues:

1.  **Correcting P&L Calculation**: The P&L was initially not showing Net Purchases (Purchases minus Purchase Returns) and was not correctly handling the sign for Sales Returns.
2.  **Excluding Tax Accounts**: Ensured that Input Tax Credit and Output Tax Payable accounts, which are balance sheet items, are correctly excluded from the P&L statement.
3.  **Debugging & Fixing**:
    *   Identified that Purchase Returns account was missing from P&L due to an incorrect  attribute, which was then corrected.
    *   Fixed a bug where Sales Returns were appearing with an incorrect sign.
    *   Added default dates for Sales Invoices and Credit Notes in their respective router files ( and ) to prevent issues during Journal Entry creation, a bug identified by the testing agent during P&L verification.
4.  **Database Cleanup**: After the P&L fixes were implemented and verified by the testing agent, a final cleanup of all test data was performed using  and  to ensure a pristine state for future testing.

The current state is that the P&L statement calculation is now mathematically correct, adheres to accounting principles (Net Purchases, exclusion of tax accounts), and has been verified by the testing agent. The database is clean and reinitialized with default data.

Verify the P&L statement functionality by manually testing with various scenarios.

The AI engineer's work involved critical financial module fixes and environment stability enhancements for the GiLi ERP application. Initially, it verified and corrected the Profit & Loss statement logic, ensuring accurate Net Purchases and proper exclusion of tax accounts. Subsequently, it addressed a Balance Sheet discrepancy caused by incorrect tax accounting for Debit Notes in . A significant portion of the work focused on resolving a persistent frontend login issue after forking, which stemmed from a hardcoded, outdated backend URL in the  file. This was meticulously debugged and fixed. Finally, the engineer automated this fix by creating and integrating a startup script into supervisor, ensuring the correct backend URL is configured automatically, thereby enhancing application stability in new environments.

<product_requirements>
The GiLi ERP project is an MVP clone for retail, aiming for React, FastAPI, MongoDB, and an Electron PoS. It includes CRUD for sales/purchase documents, stock management, and comprehensive financial modules with multi-currency and Indian tax compliance. User requests focused on:
1.  **Payment-Invoice Allocation:** Implementation of features for linking payments to invoices.
2.  **Bank Reconciliation:** Development of functionalities for bank statement reconciliation.
3.  **Credit Note (CN) & Debit Note (DN) Enhancements:** Making invoice selection optional, auto-fetching customer/supplier, adjusting AR/AP, handling fully paid invoices, maintaining audit trails, rejecting over-credit, cumulative tracking, and ensuring payment allocation reversal.
4.  **Financial Reporting Accuracy:** Correcting Journal Entry logic for Purchase Invoices, ensuring accurate Trial Balance, and refining the Profit & Loss statement to display Net Purchases (Purchases - Purchase Returns) and correctly exclude tax accounts.
5.  **Environment Stability:** Addressing and automating fixes for issues like frontend login failures after forking, caused by incorrect backend URL configuration.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Handles the creation and accounting entries for Debit Notes.
    -   **Changes Made**: Corrected the tax account used for Debit Notes' accounting entries, ensuring Tax Payable is credited instead of Input Tax Credit for GST reversal.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Manages the running processes (backend, frontend, mongodb) and their environment variables. This file is critical for service configuration.
    -   **Changes Made**: The  environment variable for the  program was updated to reflect the correct backend URL () from a hardcoded, outdated URL. Also modified to include  before the frontend starts.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Document for tracking testing progress, communication with testing agents, and storing test results.
    -   **Changes Made**: Continuously updated to reflect the status of P&L and Balance Sheet verification, and later, the login fix and its automation.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical and recurring issue where users were unable to login after forking the application. The root cause was identified as the frontend loading an outdated backend URL due to a hardcoded entry in the  file, which was overriding the  file and React's build-time environment variable resolution.

The engineer meticulously debugged this by:
1.  Checking service statuses and database users.
2.  Verifying backend logs and the frontend's  configuration.
3.  Confirming the backend login API was functional via .
4.  Using screenshots and console logs to pinpoint the frontend's use of an incorrect, cached backend URL.

After fixing the  with the correct  and restarting the frontend, the login issue was resolved. To prevent recurrence, an automated solution was implemented:
1.  Created  to dynamically update .
2.  Created  to execute  automatically.
3.  Integrated  into  to run before the frontend service starts.
4.  Developed  and updated , , and  for documentation.

The current state is that the automated fix is fully implemented, verified, and ensures the frontend connects to the correct backend URL upon startup, resolving the persistent login issue after forking.

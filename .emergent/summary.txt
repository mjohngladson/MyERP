The AI engineer's work primarily focused on resolving critical deployment and application-level bugs while progressively adding requested features. Initial challenges involved fixing a mixed content error and ensuring  was correctly propagated on Railway, culminating in identifying and fixing a subtle CORS preflight issue where middleware was incorrectly ordered. A significant logical bug was found in Debit Notes, where an  variable was undefined during subtotal calculation. Frontend enhancements included adding submitted and cancelled status options to DN/CN forms, and fixing supplier population in Purchase Orders/Invoices. Backend logic was refined to handle case sensitivity in status validation. Database issues were tackled by initializing the Chart of Accounts, and subsequently updating account documents with  and  fields to ensure they were visible in the frontend. The latest work involved persistent debugging of frontend cache issues, where despite explicit rebuilds and environment variable verification, the UI continued to display stale data, likely due to aggressive browser caching or static file serving mechanisms.

The GiLi project is an ERPNext MVP clone for retail, utilizing React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, complemented by an offline Electron PoS. It encompasses core CRUD, view, and Send functionalities for Sales Invoices, Sales Orders, Quotations, Purchase Orders, and Purchase Invoices, alongside advanced list features, a collapsible sidebar, and robust Global Search. The system includes a comprehensive Stock module, full CRUD for Items, Customers, and Suppliers, and advanced Credit Note/Debit Note modules with real SMS/Email integration (Twilio, SendGrid), dynamic autocompletes, and uniform send status tracking. A comprehensive Financial Management system has been implemented for accounting, payments, bank reconciliation, and financial reports, designed for multi-currency and Indian tax compliance. Recent work addressed financial module issues, automated document workflows, refined transaction forms, improved validation, and added mandatory field indicators. The application requires accurate routing, secure HTTPS communication, and flexible deployment between preview and production environments.

**File Summaries:**
-   : Added a new  POST endpoint to enable email/SMS functionality for purchase invoices. Corrected the supplier listing API path from  to .
-   : Modified update endpoint to convert the  field to lowercase before validation to ensure case-insensitive status transitions (e.g., Submitted becomes submitted).
-   : Fixed a critical bug where  was undefined when calculating the subtotal during , leading to server errors on POST requests. Implemented  on the  field in both create and update endpoints for case-insensitive validation.
-   : Updated account documents (implicitly via script) to include  and  fields, essential for filtering and displaying accounts in the Chart of Accounts frontend.
-   : Crucially reordered the  to be applied *before* any API routers are included, resolving CORS preflight ( method) issues for POST/PUT/DELETE requests. Also, ensured  works by checking configuration.
-   : Confirmed that backend validation logic already supported submitted and cancelled statuses for credit/debit notes.
-   : Modified to allow easy switching between Preview and Railway backend URLs by commenting/uncommenting the  entries.
-   : Implicitly involved in  and  changes; safety checks were added to ensure the  prop is always an array.
-   : Added Submitted and Cancelled as options to the status dropdown.
-   : Added Submitted and Cancelled as options to the status dropdown. Added safety checks for supplier autocomplete to handle potentially empty or undefined supplier data.
-   : Corrected the API endpoint used for fetching supplier data from  to .
-   : Fixed logic to correctly populate the  field when loading existing purchase order data, and corrected the supplier listing API path.
-   : Implemented a Send button with associated modal and API call, enabling email/SMS functionality for submitted/paid purchase invoices. Standardized the icon used for the Send action to match other modules ( icon, , ).
-   : Fixed logic to correctly populate the  field when loading existing purchase invoice data, and corrected the supplier listing API path.
-   : Frontend component for displaying Chart of Accounts. The component was showing incorrect data, requiring backend API adjustments.
-   : Modified to explicitly use  and removed debug logs. Involved in debugging environment variable propagation.
-   : (NEW) Script created to initialize a comprehensive Chart of Accounts in the MongoDB database, including essential asset, liability, equity, income, and expense accounts.
-   : (NEW) Python script to safely drop all specified collections in the MongoDB database, allowing for a fresh start with data.

Backend URL Switcher

Usage: ./switch-backend.sh [option]

Options:
  preview    - Switch to Preview Mode (Emergent Platform)
  railway    - Switch to Railway Production
  current    - Show current backend URL
  help       - Show this help message

Example:
  ./switch-backend.sh preview
  ./switch-backend.sh railway: (NEW) Shell script to easily switch the  in the frontend's  file between preview and production Railway URLs.

<pending_tasks>
-   Investigate and resolve the persistent frontend caching issue causing stale data to display despite correct  being embedded in the build.
-   Implement additional Financial Management features (e.g., Bank Reconciliation, Payment-Invoice Allocation), as initially outlined in the product requirements.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a deep debugging session related to the frontend displaying stale data in the Chart of Accounts, specifically incorrect account numbers and counts. This occurred despite multiple rebuilds of the frontend and verification that the  in  was correctly set to , and that this URL was successfully embedded in the frontend's JavaScript bundle. The user explicitly stated, there is still mismatch , seems like it is pointing to railway api url (Chat 468), indicating that even after rebuilding and restarting the frontend, the UI was fetching data from the old Railway production backend, not the intended Preview backend. The problem's root cause is suspected to be aggressive browser caching of the frontend application or an issue with how the  command handles static assets with updated environment variables, leading to the user consistently seeing an outdated version of the application despite server-side changes. The latest action involved attempting to force a complete cache clear and rebuild to definitively resolve this caching anomaly.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to run the force cache clear and rebuild, then take a screenshot of the Chart of Accounts to confirm the correct data is displayed, verifying the still mismatch issue is resolved.

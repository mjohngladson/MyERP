The AI engineer successfully progressed the GiLi ERP application from an MVP to a feature-rich retail solution, implementing comprehensive modules and addressing critical bug fixes. Initial work included Master Data, Credit/Debit Notes, and a complete Financial Management system. The current trajectory focused heavily on refining the Financial Management module, addressing user-reported issues such as missing UI for financial settings, missing CRUD for Payment/Journal Entries, inaccurate financial reports, and duplicate document numbering.

Key improvements included adding filtering, sorting, and insights to financial modules, enforcing unique document IDs, and automating workflows for document creation (e.g., Quotation to Sales Order, Sales Invoice to Journal/Payment Entry). The engineer also implemented status-based controls for editing, deleting, and sending transactions across various modules. The final issue encountered was a persistent autocomplete problem in Credit Notes due to a 404 error from the  endpoint, which the AI was actively debugging to identify routing misconfigurations. The systematic approach to fixing each user-reported issue demonstrates a methodical development process.

<product_requirements>
The GiLi project is an ERPNext MVP clone for retail, built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, including an offline Electron PoS. Core functionality includes CRUD, view, and Send capabilities for Sales Invoices, Sales Orders, Quotations, Purchase Orders, and Purchase Invoices, with advanced list features. The application features a collapsible sidebar, robust Create and Global Search, a complete Stock module, and full CRUD for Items, Customers, and Suppliers with configurable fields. Credit Note and Debit Note modules support real SMS/Email functionality (Twilio, SendGrid) with PDF attachments, dynamic item/customer population using autocomplete search, and uniform send status tracking. A comprehensive Financial Management system was recently built, encompassing accounting, payments, bank reconciliation, and financial reports, designed for multi-currency, GST/Tax compliance, and Indian accounting standards, integrating with existing Sales and Purchase modules. Recent enhancements involved fixing financial module issues, implementing automated document workflows, and refining transaction forms.

<code_architecture>



-   : Handles configuration. Added financial configs (currency, tax, accounting standards) and timezone setting.
-   : Core API for Financial Mgmt. Added CRUD, validations, unique numbering for Payments/Journal Entries. Updated reports to use actual entries, fixed date handling.
-   : Handles Credit Notes. Linked to Sales Invoices, generates accounting entries on submission. Delete with linked record checks.
-   : Handles Debit Notes. Linked to Purchase Invoices, generates accounting entries on submission. Delete with linked record checks.
-   : Handles Sales Quotations. Delete with linked record checks. Creates Sales Order on submission.
-   : Handles Sales Orders/Invoices. SO delete with linked record checks. SO creates SI on submission. SI creates Journal/Payment Entries on submission.
-   : Handles Purchase Orders/Invoices. PO delete with linked record checks. PO creates PI on submission.
-   : Handles Purchase Invoices. Creates Journal/Payment Entries on submission.
-   : MongoDB connection. Added financial collections. Enforced unique indexes for payment/journal entry numbers.
-   : Pydantic models. Expanded for Financial Management entities.
-   : FastAPI entry point. Registered  router.
-    & : Scripts to fix/prevent duplicate payment/journal entry numbers and create unique indexes.
-   : Reusable search. Prop mismatch ( to ) fixed in usage.
-   : Frontend settings. Added 'Financial' and 'System' tabs for financial configs and timezone.
-   : Frontend for Payments. Added CRUD, validations, filters, sorting, status dropdown. Fixed  error, button visibility.
-   : Frontend for Journal Entries. Added CRUD, validations, filters, sorting, status dropdown, insights. Fixed date filter, button visibility.
-   : Financial Dashboard. Displays 'Total Received'/'Total Paid' from payments.
-   : Financial Reports. Ensures 'to date' defaults to current date.
-   : Lists Sales Orders. Added delete handler with linked record checks.
-    & : Lists CN/DN. Status-based visibility for Edit/Delete/Send buttons.
-   Forms (, etc.): Transaction forms. Status dropdowns added then rolled back. CN/DN forms: made invoice mandatory, autocomplete enabled (prop fix).

<pending_tasks>
- Resolve the 404 error for  endpoint currently affecting Credit Note autocomplete.
- Implement status-based 'send' control across all transaction modules (SQ, SO, SI, PO, PI, CN, DN): allow send only after submission, disallow edit/delete after submission.
- Ensure comprehensive upsert validations are in place for SQ, SO, SI, PO, PI, CN, DN.
- Implement additional Financial Management features (e.g., Bank Reconciliation, Payment-Invoice Allocation).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was debugging a persistent issue where customer and invoice data were not populating in the Credit Note form's autocomplete fields. This followed previous attempts to make reference invoice fields mandatory with autocomplete and fixing prop mismatches ( vs. ) in the  component's usage within  and .

The current debugging session identified the root cause: the backend endpoint  was returning a 404 error. The AI was in the process of investigating the FastAPI backend's routing configuration for sales invoices, specifically checking  and , to understand why the endpoint was not correctly accessible when the trajectory concluded.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix the 404 error for the  endpoint.

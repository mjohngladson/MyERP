The AI engineer successfully built core ERP modules (Sales, Quotation, Purchase) from an MVP, and then focused on fixing critical bugs and expanding functionality. Initial tasks involved UI alignment, filter-aware statistics, and responsive search. Significant effort went into resolving frontend JSX errors, backend 502/500 errors, and ensuring data loading and API robustness through  retries. Key features developed include a collapsible sidebar with persistence, an accordion style, and comprehensive Create and Global Search features with quick actions and improved navigation. Later, a full Stock module was added, along with CRUD for Master Data (Items, Customers, Suppliers). All new features are driven by a new, consolidated General Settings system. The trajectory shows an iterative process of bug fixing, feature implementation, and extensive communication with the user for clarifications and verification, with a strong emphasis on robust API interaction and UI consistency. The persistent 502 errors, initially thought to be backend, were eventually correlated with ingress issues and frontend retry logic.

The GiLi project aims to be a comprehensive React/FastAPI/MongoDB ERPNext MVP clone, including an offline Electron PoS. Initial requirements covered CRUD APIs, authentication, global search, and advanced reporting. The project expanded to a full-fledged app for retail, starting with a complete Sales Invoice System (pre-Sales Orders, tax calculations). This grew to full CRUD, view, and Send capabilities for Sales Invoices, Sales Orders, and Quotations, with advanced list features (sorting, filtering, debounced search) and manual status changes. Subsequently, Purchase Order and Purchase Invoice modules were implemented similarly, followed by filter-aware statistics for all modules, consistent UI alignment, and 500ms debounced search. Recent user-driven requirements include a collapsible/persistent sidebar, robust Create and Global Search functionality, a complete Stock module (Items, Warehouses, Stock Entries, Ledger, Reports, Batches/Serials), and full CRUD for Items, Customers, and Suppliers with rich, configurable fields based on ERP for retail standards, all managed via a consolidated General Settings system.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on implementing detailed ERP retail-ready fields for Items, Customers, and Suppliers, with their visibility and defaults driven by a new, consolidated General Settings system.

This involves:
1.  **General Settings**: Backend () is fully implemented with defaults for tax, variants, UoMs, payment terms, and consolidated stock sub-settings. The frontend () provides a new consolidated UI with tabs (Tax, Items, Stock, Payments) replacing the standalone Stock Settings.
2.  **Master Data CRUD**: Backend endpoints are set up for Customers, Suppliers, and Items. Frontend  and  with full CRUD are implemented.  is in place, and its CRUD UI is being finalized with conditional fields based on  (e.g., GST fields, item variants).
3.  **Sales Module Enhancements**: The task is to fix  to load by ID and render full details, and to enable  view/edit flows from the list, utilizing the centralized API client.
4.  **Reports and Search**: Ensuring the top-level Reports link correctly opens the consolidated Valuation/Reorder page, and fixing the Stock Entry quick action in Global Search to navigate to .
5.  **Overall Stability**: Continued conversion of  calls to the centralized  client with retries and exponential backoff, and ensuring all new forms and UI elements respect the new General Settings for conditional field visibility.

The AI engineer's work primarily focused on resolving critical deployment and application-level issues, followed by a significant feature enhancement, and then a final environment switch. The initial challenge involved diagnosing a persistent frontend URL mismatch, which was ultimately traced to a hardcoded backend URL within the supervisor configuration, overriding the  settings. After this was fixed, the focus shifted to enhancing document workflows (Quotations, Sales, Purchase, Invoices) to ensure accounting entries and subsequent document creation triggered immediately upon direct submission, not just from a draft state. Finally, the environment was explicitly switched back to Railway production, involving further supervisor configuration updates and  file rectification, with a verification of CORS settings.

The GiLi project is an ERPNext MVP clone for retail, utilizing React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, complemented by an offline Electron PoS. It encompasses core CRUD, view, and Send functionalities for Sales Invoices, Sales Orders, Quotations, Purchase Orders, and Purchase Invoices, alongside advanced list features, a collapsible sidebar, and robust Global Search. The system includes a comprehensive Stock module, full CRUD for Items, Customers, and Suppliers, and advanced Credit Note/Debit Note modules with real SMS/Email integration (Twilio, SendGrid), dynamic autocompletes, and uniform send status tracking. A comprehensive Financial Management system has been implemented for accounting, payments, bank reconciliation, and financial reports, designed for multi-currency and Indian tax compliance. Recent work addressed financial module issues, automated document workflows, refined transaction forms, improved validation, and added mandatory field indicators. The application requires accurate routing, secure HTTPS communication, and flexible deployment between preview and production environments.

-   : Added a new  POST endpoint and corrected supplier listing API path. Modified  and  endpoints to trigger  for journal entries.
-   : Status validation was made case-insensitive. The existing workflow for accounting entries was reviewed and confirmed to be correct for both  and  operations.
-   : Fixed a critical bug where  was undefined during subtotal calculation. Status validation was also made case-insensitive. The existing workflow for accounting entries was reviewed and confirmed to be correct for both  and  operations.
-   : Created and integrated  into  and  endpoints to automatically create Sales Orders when a quotation is submitted.
-   : Created and integrated  into  and  endpoints to automatically create Sales Invoices when a sales order is submitted.
-   : Created and integrated  into  and  endpoints to automatically create Purchase Invoices when a purchase order is submitted.
-   : Created and integrated  into  and  endpoints to handle journal entries and payment processing when an invoice is submitted.
-   : (NEW) A new Python file created to centralize reusable workflow logic for different document types, making the router code cleaner and more modular.
-   : Updated (implicitly) to ensure account documents include  and  fields, necessary for frontend display.
-   :  order was adjusted to resolve CORS preflight issues. Origins configuration was confirmed.
-   : Modified to facilitate switching  between preview and production. A duplication issue was fixed during the final URL switch.
-   : (External Configuration File - MODIFIED) **Critically, the  environment variable for the  program was hardcoded here**, overriding . This was modified to correctly point to the intended backend URL (Preview or Railway).
-   : (NEW) Document detailing the fix for the hardcoded URL in the supervisor configuration.
-   : (NEW) Document summarizing the final URL switch of the application to the Railway production environment.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the task of switching the application's frontend and backend URLs from the Preview environment to the Railway production environment. This involved:
1.  Using the [1;33mNo option specified[0m

Backend URL Switcher

Usage: ./switch-backend.sh [option]

Options:
  preview    - Switch to Preview Mode (Emergent Platform)
  railway    - Switch to Railway Production
  current    - Show current backend URL
  help       - Show this help message

Example:
  ./switch-backend.sh preview
  ./switch-backend.sh railway script to update  with the Railway backend URL.
2.  Manually editing  to update the  for the frontend program, which was overriding the  settings.
3.  Resolving a duplicate  entry in  that occurred during the switch.
4.  Restarting the frontend service via supervisor to apply changes.
5.  Verifying the environment variable for the running frontend process and ensuring the application was accessible via the new Railway URL.
6.  Updating documentation () with the user-provided precise frontend (ui-production-ccf6.up.railway.app) and backend (myerp-production.up.railway.app) Railway URLs.
7.  Confirming that the backend's  already included the Railway frontend URL in its CORS  configuration.
The system is now fully configured to use the specified Railway production URLs.

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      message: "🚨 CRITICAL UI INTEGRATION ISSUE FOUND - PURCHASE ORDERS & QUOTATIONS NOT LOADING DATA: Comprehensive UI testing revealed major frontend integration problems. AUTHENTICATION & NAVIGATION: (1) ✅ Login with demo credentials (admin@gili.com/admin123) works perfectly (2) ✅ Navigation to Buying → Purchase Order works correctly (3) ✅ Navigation to Sales → Quotation works correctly (4) ✅ Both list pages render without runtime errors. CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND: (1) ❌ Purchase Orders list shows 0 rows despite backend having data (GET /api/purchase/orders returns 1 order: PO-20250923-0001 for ₹106.2) (2) ❌ Quotations list shows 0 rows despite backend having data (GET /api/quotations returns 1 quotation: QTN-20250924-008 for ₹236.0 with sent_at timestamp) (3) ❌ Network monitoring shows NO API calls to /api/purchase/orders or /api/quotations endpoints when navigating to these pages (4) ❌ Frontend components render but do not fetch data from backend. ROOT CAUSE: Frontend components are not properly wired to make API calls on component mount. Backend APIs are working perfectly but frontend is not calling them. IMPACT: Users cannot see Purchase Orders or Quotations data despite it existing in the database. RECOMMENDATION: Fix frontend API integration in PurchaseOrdersList.jsx and QuotationsList.jsx components to properly fetch data on mount."

ROOT CAUSE: Sidebar navigation system is broken - the onSubItemClick handler in App.js is not properly wired to the sidebar button clicks, causing navigation to fail completely.

Issues: (a) Subtotal is ₹65, not ₹200 (different product/quantity) (b) Tax rate is 9%, not 18% (3) ✅ BACKEND VERIFICATION: Created test transactions with correct 18% tax - Product A (₹100 + 18% = ₹118) and Product B (₹200 + 18% = ₹236) both processed and stored correctly (4) ✅ CALCULATION INTEGRITY CONFIRMED: Backend correctly processes subtotal + tax_amount - discount_amount = total_amount formula. CONCLUSION: Backend tax calculation system is working correctly. The discrepancy is in the SOURCE DATA being sent from PoS system to backend - incorrect tax rates (9% vs 18%), unexpected discounts, and wrong subtotals. The issue is in PoS frontend calculation logic, not backend processing."

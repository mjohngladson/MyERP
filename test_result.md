# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

All calculations must be mathematically correct per accounting principles. This is FINAL verification before production approval."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Expected: DN should NOT be created at all (even in draft). ROOT CAUSE: The over-credit validation in cn_dn_enhanced_helpers.py (lines 298-310) was only executed when status='submitted' (via create_debit_note_accounting_entries). Draft DNs bypassed this validation entirely. FIX IMPLEMENTED: (1) Moved over-credit validation from helper to create_debit_note endpoint (debit_notes.py lines 230-244). (2) Validation now runs BEFORE DN document is created in database, for both draft and submitted status. (3) Raises HTTPException 400 with clear error message: 'Debit Note creation rejected: Amount (₹X) exceeds available balance. Invoice original total: ₹Y, Already debited: ₹Z, Available for debit: ₹W. Cannot create Debit Note (even in draft) that exceeds invoice amount.' (4) Same fix applied to Credit Notes (credit_notes.py lines 235-248).

DETAILED FINDINGS: (1) ✅ Login and navigation to Credit Note form successful. (2) ❌ Console logs 'Loaded customers:' and 'Loaded invoices:' NOT FOUND - API calls failed before data could be logged to console. (3) ✅ /api/master/customers API call successful (HTTP 200, HTTPS) - returns 2 customers: ABC Corporation and XYZ Enterprises. (4) ❌ /api/invoices API call FAILED - Browser blocked with Mixed Content error: 'Mixed Content: The page at https://... was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint http://...'. (5) ✅ Customer dropdown appears when clicked but shows 0 options (data not populated due to API response not being processed). (6) ❌ Invoice dropdown appears when clicked but shows 0 options (API call completely failed). ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Backend route defined as /api/invoices/ (with trailing slash) at routers/invoices.py line 29. Frontend makes request to /api/invoices (without trailing slash) at CreditNoteForm.jsx line 36. FastAPI automatically redirects to add trailing slash (HTTP 307). Redirect Location header uses HTTP instead of HTTPS: 'location: http://erp-accounting-8.preview.emergentagent.com/api/invoices/?limit=200'. Browser blocks mixed content (HTTPS page loading HTTP resource) for security. VERIFICATION: curl test confirms HTTP 307 redirect with HTTP Location header. /api/master/customers works because it doesn't have this redirect issue. FIX REQUIRED: Change CreditNoteForm.jsx line 36 from 'api.get('/invoices', { params: { limit: 200 } })' to 'api.get('/invoices/', { params: { limit: 200 } })' to include trailing slash and avoid redirect.

(8) ✅ No Mixed Content errors detected - HTTPS working correctly. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: DATA INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN ID FORMATS. Invoice customer_id: '68f924b234f06b0b3e50332a' (MongoDB ObjectId format, 24 hex characters). Payment party_id: '061c68bc-6be0-4591-88c5-271244cc7dc0' (UUID format with hyphens).

When Payment Allocation form queries /api/invoices/?customer_id=061c68bc-6be0-4591-88c5-271244cc7dc0, the backend searches for invoices with UUID customer_id but the existing invoice has MongoDB ObjectId customer_id, resulting in no matches. VERIFICATION: Tested with actual data - invoice INV-20251023-0001 has customer_id='68f924b234f06b0b3e50332a' while payment REC-20251023-0001 has party_id='061c68bc-6be0-4591-88c5-271244cc7dc0'. Both reference 'ABC Corporation' but use different ID formats. IMPACT: CRITICAL - Users cannot allocate payments to invoices. Payment allocation feature is completely non-functional due to ID format mismatch. REQUIRED FIX OPTIONS: (1) Backend: Update existing invoices to use UUID customer_id format instead of MongoDB ObjectId. (2) Backend: Modify /api/invoices/ endpoint to handle both UUID and ObjectId formats when filtering by customer_id (dual lookup). (3) Data Migration: Run migration script to convert all MongoDB ObjectId customer references to UUID format across ALL documents (invoices, purchase_invoices, credit_notes, debit_notes, payments, etc.). RECOMMENDATION: Option 3 (data migration) is the cleanest long-term solution to ensure consistency.

TEST RESULTS: **FIX 1 - DN Over-Credit Prevention**: (1) Single DN validation - WORKING PERFECTLY: DN ₹177 > PI ₹118 correctly rejected with HTTP 400, no DN created in database. (2) Cumulative DN tracking - WORKING PERFECTLY: First DN ₹59 created successfully, second DN ₹118 (total ₹177 > PI ₹118) correctly rejected with HTTP 400 showing 'Already debited: ₹59.00', only 1 DN in database. (3) Valid cumulative DNs - WORKING PERFECTLY: Second DN ₹59 (total ₹118 = PI ₹118) accepted, 2 DNs in database totaling exactly PI amount. **FIX 2 - Quantity Integer Validation**: Confirmed still working 100% (all transaction types reject decimal quantities). TECHNICAL VERIFICATION: The fix at debit_notes.py lines 248-253 correctly implements cumulative tracking by querying debit_notes_collection for ALL DNs (draft + submitted) instead of relying on invoice field. Error messages are clear, helpful, and include cumulative amounts. No invalid documents created in database when validation fails. RECOMMENDATION: Both fixes are ready for production deployment. No further testing required."

      message: "CREDIT NOTE FORM DROPDOWN TESTING COMPLETED. ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Mixed Content Error blocking /api/invoices API call. TEST RESULTS: (1) ✅ Login successful with admin@gili.com. (2) ✅ Navigation to Credit Note form successful. (3) ❌ Console logs 'Loaded customers:' and 'Loaded invoices:' NOT FOUND - API calls failed before data could be logged. (4) ✅ Customer dropdown appears but shows 0 options (customers API returned 200 but data not displayed). (5) ❌ Invoice dropdown appears but shows 0 options (invoices API failed completely). (6) ❌ 14 console errors found: 'Mixed Content: The page at https://... was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint http://...' ROOT CAUSE: Backend route /api/invoices/ (with trailing slash) causes FastAPI to redirect from /api/invoices (without slash) to /api/invoices/ BUT the redirect Location header uses HTTP instead of HTTPS: 'location: http://erp-accounting-8.preview.emergentagent.com/api/invoices/?limit=200'. Browser blocks this mixed content request for security. VERIFICATION: curl test shows HTTP 307 redirect with HTTP Location header. /api/master/customers works fine (200 status, HTTPS). FIX REQUIRED: Change frontend CreditNoteForm.jsx line 36 from api.get('/invoices', ...) to api.get('/invoices/', ...) to include trailing slash and avoid redirect. IMPACT: HIGH - Credit Note form cannot load invoices, preventing users from selecting reference invoices."

      message: "TRAILING SLASH FIX VERIFICATION - ALL TESTS PASSED ✅. Comprehensive testing of Credit Note form dropdown population completed with 7/7 tests passing. RESULTS: (1) ✅ Console logs confirmed: 'Loaded customers: [Object, Object]' and 'Loaded invoices: [Object]' both present. (2) ✅ NO Mixed Content errors detected - security issue completely resolved. (3) ✅ Customer dropdown shows 2 customers: ABC Corporation (abc@example.com) and XYZ Enterprises (xyz@example.com). (4) ✅ Invoice dropdown shows 1 invoice: INV-20251023-0001. (5) ✅ API calls successful: /api/invoices/ returned HTTP 200 (HTTPS, no redirect), /api/master/customers returned HTTP 200. (6) ✅ NO HTTP 307 redirects detected. TECHNICAL VERIFICATION: The trailing slash fix at CreditNoteForm.jsx line 36 (changed from 'api.get('/invoices', ...)' to 'api.get('/invoices/', ...)') has completely eliminated the redirect issue. Network analysis shows both API endpoints returning 200 status with HTTPS protocol. Backend data confirmed: 2 customers and 1 invoice in database. CONCLUSION: Feature is fully functional and ready for production. Users can now successfully create Credit Notes with reference invoices. No further testing required."

      message: "PAYMENT ALLOCATION FORM - UUID MIGRATION VERIFICATION COMPLETED ✅. USER REQUEST: Test Payment Allocation form after customer_id migration to UUID format. OBJECTIVE: Verify invoice dropdown now populates correctly after fixing the customer_id format mismatch. TEST RESULTS (10 verification steps, ALL PASSED): (1) ✅ Login with admin@gili.com successful. (2) ✅ Navigated to Financial → Payments. (3) ✅ Found payment REC-20251023-0001 for ABC Corporation (₹100.00). (4) ✅ Opened payment details modal. (5) ✅ Clicked 'Allocate Payment' button - allocation form opened. (6) ✅ CRITICAL SUCCESS: Console logs show 'Loaded invoices: 1 from 1 total' (previously showed 0). (7) ✅ CRITICAL SUCCESS: Invoice dropdown NOW CONTAINS INV-20251023-0001 - ₹0.00 (Unpaid) (previously empty). (8) ✅ Invoice is selectable from dropdown. (9) ✅ No console errors detected. (10) ✅ No Mixed Content errors. BEFORE vs AFTER MIGRATION: BEFORE: Console 'Loaded invoices: 0 from 0 total', dropdown empty, API returned []. AFTER: Console 'Loaded invoices: 1 from 1 total', dropdown shows INV-20251023-0001, API returns invoice data. ROOT CAUSE RESOLUTION: The migration successfully updated invoice customer_id from MongoDB ObjectId format '68f924b234f06b0b3e50332a' to UUID format '061c68bc-6be0-4591-88c5-271244cc7dc0', matching the payment's party_id. The API query /api/invoices/?customer_id=061c68bc-6be0-4591-88c5-271244cc7dc0 now correctly returns the invoice. CONCLUSION: ✅✅✅ MIGRATION 100% SUCCESSFUL! Payment Allocation feature is now fully functional. Users can successfully allocate payments to invoices. The customer_id UUID migration has completely resolved the data inconsistency issue. Feature ready for production use."

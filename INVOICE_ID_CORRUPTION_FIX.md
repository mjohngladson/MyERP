# Invoice ID Corruption Fix - Sales & Purchase Invoices

**Date**: Current Session
**Issue**: Invoice IDs being corrupted when returned from API

## Problem Statement

### Symptoms
- Payment allocation failing with "Invoice [short-hex-id] not found"
- Example IDs: `68f3ef4d9701123414066cae`, `68e44aaf2e2320563b568fd7`
- Issue affected both Sales Invoices (SI) and Purchase Invoices (PI)

### Root Cause - ID Overwriting Bug

Both invoice routers had the same critical bug:

**Sales Invoices** (`/app/backend/routers/invoices.py`):
```python
# Line 117 - WRONG CODE:
if "_id" in invoice:
    invoice["id"] = str(invoice["_id"])  # ❌ Overwrites UUID with ObjectId!
    del invoice["_id"]
```

**Purchase Invoices** (`/app/backend/routers/purchase_invoices.py`):
```python
# Lines 98-100 - WRONG CODE:
if '_id' in inv:
    inv['id'] = str(inv['_id'])  # ❌ Overwrites UUID with ObjectId!
    del inv['_id']
```

### Why This is Wrong

**MongoDB Object Structure**:
```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("68f3ef4d9701123414066cae"),  // MongoDB auto-generated
  "id": "2383616f-d6da-4fff-909b-36f2386e3544",   // Our UUID
  "invoice_number": "INV-20251018-0010",
  ...
}
```

**What the Bug Did**:
1. Converted MongoDB ObjectId to string: `"68f3ef4d9701123414066cae"` (24 chars)
2. Overwrote the proper UUID field with this short hex
3. Deleted the `_id` field
4. Returned corrupted ID to frontend

**Result**: Frontend received short ObjectId strings instead of proper UUIDs

### Impact on Payment Allocation

1. **Frontend loads invoices**: Receives corrupted IDs
2. **User selects invoice**: Dropdown shows corrupted ID
3. **Allocation API called**: Sends corrupted ID like `68f3ef4d9701123414066cae`
4. **Backend searches**: `find_one({"id": "68f3ef4d9701123414066cae"})`
5. **Not found**: Database has proper UUID, search fails
6. **Error**: "Invoice 68f3ef4d9701123414066cae not found"

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed Code Logic

**Correct approach**:
1. ✅ Preserve existing UUID `id` field
2. ✅ Delete `_id` without using it
3. ✅ Only generate fallback ID if `id` is missing

### Sales Invoices Fix

**File**: `/app/backend/routers/invoices.py` (lines 113-135)

**After (CORRECT)**:
```python
transformed_invoices = []
for invoice in invoices:
    try:
        # Remove MongoDB _id but preserve UUID id field
        if "_id" in invoice:
            del invoice["_id"]  # ✅ Just delete, don't overwrite
        # Only set fallback id if no id field exists
        if "id" not in invoice or not invoice["id"]:
            invoice["id"] = f"inv-{str(uuid.uuid4())[:8]}"  # ✅ Fallback only
        # ... rest of defaults ...
```

### Purchase Invoices Fix

**File**: `/app/backend/routers/purchase_invoices.py`

**1. List endpoint (lines 96-108)**:
```python
transformed = []
for inv in invoices:
    # Remove MongoDB _id but preserve UUID id field
    if '_id' in inv:
        del inv['_id']  # ✅ Just delete
    # Only set fallback id if no id field exists
    if 'id' not in inv or not inv['id']:
        inv['id'] = f"pinv-{str(uuid.uuid4())[:8]}"  # ✅ Fallback only
    # ... rest of defaults ...
```

**2. Single invoice endpoint (lines 122-129)**:
```python
if '_id' in inv:
    del inv['_id']  # ✅ Just delete
# Only set fallback id if no id field exists
if 'id' not in inv or not inv['id']:
    inv['id'] = f"pinv-{str(uuid.uuid4())[:8]}"  # ✅ Fallback only
```

**3. Added import**:
```python
import uuid  # Added to line 6
```

## Files Modified

1. `/app/backend/routers/invoices.py`
   - Lines 113-135: Fixed invoice ID handling in list endpoint
   - Preserves UUID, only uses fallback for legacy records

2. `/app/backend/routers/purchase_invoices.py`
   - Line 6: Added `import uuid`
   - Lines 96-108: Fixed invoice ID handling in list endpoint
   - Lines 122-129: Fixed invoice ID handling in single fetch endpoint
   - Preserves UUID, only uses fallback for legacy records

## Testing Verification

### Test 1: Sales Invoice Allocation ✅
1. Create Payment Entry (Type: Receive, Customer)
2. Click "Allocate Payment"
3. ✅ Invoice dropdown shows invoices with proper UUIDs
4. Select invoice and enter amount
5. ✅ Click "Allocate Payment"
6. ✅ Allocation saves successfully
7. ✅ Invoice status updates to "Partially Paid" or "Paid"

### Test 2: Purchase Invoice Allocation ✅
1. Create Payment Entry (Type: Pay, Supplier)
2. Click "Allocate Payment"
3. ✅ Purchase Invoice dropdown shows invoices with proper UUIDs
4. Select invoice and enter amount
5. ✅ Click "Allocate Payment"
6. ✅ Allocation saves successfully
7. ✅ Invoice status updates accordingly

### Test 3: Console Verification
Open browser console when payment allocation form opens:
```
Raw invoice data: [...]
First invoice sample: {
  id: "2383616f-d6da-4fff-909b-36f2386e3544",  // ✅ Proper UUID (36 chars)
  _id: undefined,  // ✅ Removed
  invoice_number: "INV-20251018-0010",
  hasProperUUID: true  // ✅ Length check passes
}
Loaded invoices: 5 from 10 total
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### Legacy Invoices
If old invoices exist without UUID `id` field:
- Fallback generates short ID: `inv-a1b2c3d4` or `pinv-e5f6g7h8`
- These still work for allocation
- Better than corrupted ObjectId strings

### New Invoices
All new invoices created with proper UUID:
- Sales: `str(uuid.uuid4())` in CREATE endpoint
- Purchase: `str(uuid.uuid4())` in CREATE endpoint
- These preserve correctly through list endpoint

## Why The Fix Works

**Before**: 
- MongoDB `_id` (ObjectId) → Converted to string → Overwrote UUID
- Result: `"68f3ef4d9701123414066cae"` (wrong!)

**After**:
- MongoDB `_id` → Simply deleted
- UUID `id` → Preserved unchanged
- Result: `"2383616f-d6da-4fff-909b-36f2386e3544"` (correct!)

**Allocation Lookup**:
- Frontend sends: `"2383616f-d6da-4fff-909b-36f2386e3544"`
- Backend searches: `find_one({"id": "2383616f-d6da-4fff-909b-36f2386e3544"})`
- Database has: `"id": "2383616f-d6da-4fff-909b-36f2386e3544"`
- ✅ Match found!

## Deployment

- ✅ Backend service restarted
- ✅ Changes live in preview environment
- ✅ Both Sales and Purchase invoice allocation working

## Summary

✅ **Sales Invoices**: ID preservation fixed
✅ **Purchase Invoices**: ID preservation fixed  
✅ **Payment Allocation**: Now works for both SI and PI
✅ **No Data Loss**: UUIDs preserved, only ObjectId handling changed
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Fallback for legacy records without UUIDs

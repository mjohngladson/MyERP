# Bug Fixes - Payment Allocation & Bank Reconciliation

**Date**: Current Session
**Issues Reported**: Payment allocation and bank reconciliation report errors

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Payment Allocation - Invoice Loading Error

**Problem**: Payment allocation form was failing to load invoices for supplier payments

**Root Cause**: 
- Form was using `/api/invoices` endpoint for all payments
- Supplier payments need `/api/purchase/invoices` endpoint instead

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Before: Only used /api/invoices
const res = await fetch(`${base}/api/invoices?${partyQuery}&limit=100`);

// After: Use correct endpoint based on party type
const endpoint = isCustomer 
  ? `${base}/api/invoices?${partyQuery}&limit=100`
  : `${base}/api/purchase/invoices?${partyQuery}&limit=100`;
```

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/frontend/src/components/PaymentAllocationForm.jsx` (lines 18-39)

**Fix Applied**:
- Added logic to detect payment party type (Customer vs Supplier)
- Routes to `/api/invoices` for customer payments (sales invoices)
- Routes to `/api/purchase/invoices` for supplier payments (purchase invoices)
- Both endpoints now correctly filter by party_id

### 2. Payment Allocation - Undefined State Error

**Problem**: "setAllocatingPayment is not defined" error when clicking Allocate Payment button

**Root Cause**: 
- PaymentViewModal component was directly calling state setters from parent component
- State functions were not passed as props to the modal component

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Before: Direct state access in modal (not available)
onClick={() => {
  setAllocatingPayment(payment);
  setShowAllocationForm(true);
}}

// After: Use callback prop
onClick={() => onAllocate(payment)}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/frontend/src/components/PaymentEntry.jsx` 
  - Line 823: Added `onAllocate` prop to PaymentViewModal signature
  - Lines 540-547: Passed `onAllocate` callback to PaymentViewModal
  - Lines 964-971: Updated button to use `onAllocate` prop instead of direct state calls

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `onAllocate` callback prop to PaymentViewModal
- PaymentEntry passes handler that sets allocation state
- Modal now properly triggers allocation form via callback

### 3. Bank Reconciliation - Report Modal Error

**Problem**: Report button throwing error when clicked

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing `X` icon import from lucide-react
- Report modal close button using undefined icon
- Insufficient error handling in API call

**Solution**:
1. **Added Missing Import**:
```javascript
// Before
import { Upload, RefreshCw, FileText, CheckCircle, XCircle, AlertCircle, 
  ChevronLeft, Download, Trash2, Eye, Filter } from 'lucide-react';

// After
import { Upload, RefreshCw, FileText, CheckCircle, XCircle, AlertCircle, 
  ChevronLeft, Download, Trash2, Eye, Filter, X } from 'lucide-react';
```

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
```javascript
// Added response status check
if (!res.ok) {
  const errorData = await res.json();
  throw new Error(errorData.detail || 'Failed to load report');
}

// Added user-friendly error alert
alert(`Error loading report: ${err.message}`);
```

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/frontend/src/components/BankReconciliation.jsx` (lines 1-5, 172-191)

**Improvements**:
- ✅ X icon properly imported for close button
- ✅ HTTP error responses now properly caught and displayed
- ✅ User gets clear error message if report fails to load
- ✅ Console errors for debugging
